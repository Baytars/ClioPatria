---+ ClioPatria source-code roadmap

This interface runs PlDoc, the SWI-Prolog literate-programming interface
on top of ClioPatria. You can use the top-left menu to browse files in a
given directory and the top-right menu to search for predicates.

The main directories in ClioPatria are listed below. Note that you can
get an overview of the Prolog files in them by selecting a directory
from the top-left menu.

    $ api :
    Provides HTTP handlers that return JSON or XML that is typically
    not for human consumption.

    $ applications :
    Provides HTTP handlers for (typically) HTML pages for human
    consumption.

    $ client :
    Provides (Sesame compatible) client code.  This is not part
    of ClioPatria, but is often used in similar contexts.  Note
    that a SPARQL client is part of the SWI-Prolog semweb package.

    $ components :
    DCG-rules that produce HTML.  These are reusable components to
    build _applications_.

    $ doc :
    Generate the documentation.

    $ lib :
    Reusable code which we envision might become part of the SWI-Prolog
    libraries.  This directory is made available through the alias
    =library= and files in it can thus be loaded using e.g.,

        ==
	:- use_module(library(semweb/rdf_abstract)).
	==

    $ ontologies :
    Some core-ontologies that are used in nearly many domains where
    ClioPatria is being deployed.  Note that you can load these ontologies
    using the menu-item *|File/Load base ontology|*.

    $ rdfql :
    Implementation for RDF query languages: SPARQL and SeRQL. The
    provided functionality is typically only used through the HTTP-API.

    $ test :
    Test-framework, notably to verify SPARQL compliance.

    $ web :
    Web-pages used by the server: CSS, Icons, JavaScript and YUI files.
