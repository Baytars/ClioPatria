---+ Tutorial work

    * How to add a web-page
    * How to define a new skin

---+ Implementation work

    * Test LOD
    * Extend the HTML browser with RDFa
    * Renamed (git) components to modules in version.pl?

---+ Configuration

Seems we are falling into the same trap   as Apache, building up a giant
config file. We must modularize this.  This   is  probably not very hard
because the ordering of code that is loaded typically doesn't matter.

One of the options is to create a directory with small config blocks, as
we now have sections in run.pl.in.  Say examples/config. Now also create
an (empty) directory config. All *.pl  files   in  config  are loaded in
alphabetical order. Maybe  we  should   name  the  files 00-prefixes.pl,
10-settings.pl, etc. Or, A5-, B5, etc.?

---+ Prolog

Fix location and presentation of multifile   (hooks) in PlDoc: move them
to the end, get colouring consistent and put [multifile] into the title.
