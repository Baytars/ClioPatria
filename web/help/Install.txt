---+ Installation and Administration

---++ Getting started

Create run.pl from run.pl.in. On Unix system, run =|./configure|= to
accompish this. On Windows, double click setup.pl. The created file
run.pl loads and starts the server. There are several configuration
options that may be selected by editing run.pl according to the comments
in this file.

Next, start the server by running =|./run.pl|= (Unix) or double-clicking
run.pl (Windows). Now direct your browser to the server, using the
default setup this is \url{http://localhost:3020}. If no users are
defined the browser will prompt to enter the administrative password.
After that the admin and anonymous users are created. Accounts can be
created and modified by users with administrative rights through the
\emph{Admin/Users} link in the menu.


---++ Configuring the server

To configure the server, login as \const{admin} and click
*|Admin/Settings|*. Edit settings and hit *Apply* to save them. In most
cases you will have to restart the server before the new settings take
effect.
