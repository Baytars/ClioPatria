---+ Downloading ClioPatria

ClioPatria can be downloaded using the [[GIT][http://git-scm.com/]]
version control system only. Why? Because ClioPatria's package manager
CPACK is based on GIT, so you need GIT anyway.

---++ Step one, get GIT

First install GIT for for your platform. On Windows, there are two
versions. We assume
[[msysgit][http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list?can=3]],
which has become the preferred version on the GIT download page as well.
Linux systems have a package, often called =|git-core|=, so Debian or
Ubuntu you use

    ==
    % sudo apt-get install git-core
    ==

You need at least version 1.6 of GIT!

---++ Step two, get SWI-Prolog

Download and install [[SWI-Prolog][http://www.swi-prolog.org]]. As
ClioPatria and its packages are under active development, you often need
the [[development version][http://www.swi-prolog.org/download/devel]] of
SWI-Prolog.


---++ Step two, download ClioPatria

With GIT installed, this is simple. Open a terminal in the right
directory and run the command below, which creates a directory
=ClioPatria= in the current directory.

    ==
    % git clone git://www.swi-prolog.org/home/pl/git/ClioPatria.git
    ==

You can [[browse][http://www.swi-prolog.org/git/ClioPatria.git]] the
sources online.
