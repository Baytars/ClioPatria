---+ Creating a project in ClioPatria

You can create a project inside the downloaded =ClioPatria= directory,
but often it is to be preferred to create it in a new directory.
Unfortunately, the story is different for Windows and Unix.

---++ Creating a project in Unix (Linux, MacOSX, etc.)

We assume that you created a directory next to ClioPatria. For example
using the commands below, but you can of course also use the GUI of your
OS.

    ==
    % ls
    ClioPatria
    % mkdir myproject
    % cd myproject
    ==

Now configure this directory as a ClioPatria project by running

    ==
    % ../ClioPatria/configure
    ==

This script creates a directory =|config-enabled|= and a file =|run.pl|=
in the current directory. By default the server is configured to run on
port 3020. If you prefer another port, edit the file
=|config-enabled/network.pl|=. Now you are ready to run ClioPatria using
the command below.

    ==
    ./run.pl
    ==

Next direct your browser to =|http://localhost:3020|= (or whatever port
you selected) and enter a name and password for the administrator user.


---++ Creating a project in MS-Windows

The procedure in Windows is comparable, but   based on using the Windows
file explorer. First, create a folder =myproject= next to the downloaded
=ClioPatria= folder. Next, run =|setup.pl|=   in  =ClioPatria= by double
clicking it. This prompts for  a   project  directory. Specify the newly
created =myproject=. Now double click  =|run.pl|=   that  is  created in
=myproject= and direct your  browser   to  =|http://localhost:3020|= (or
whatever port you selected). Then enter  a   name  and  password for the
administrator user.
