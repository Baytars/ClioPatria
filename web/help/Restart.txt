---+ Restarting from scratch: where is the data kept?

Data is kept in the following files. Each of these can be removed.

    $ settings.db :
This keeps settings that do not have their default value.  You
can freely edit this file if the server is not running.  Note that
the settings can change the locations of the items below.

    $ users.db :
This keeps the registered users and their permissions.  You can
freely edit this file if the server is not running.  Passwords
are stored as MD5-hashes.

    $ RDF-store :
This directory holds backup of the RDF data. Each named-graph is
represented by two (optional) files. The base of this file is an encoded
version of the graph-name. The extensions are =trp= for
quick-load snapshots and =jrn= for _journal_ files. See
the SWI-Prolog [[Semantic Web
package][http://www.swi-prolog.org/packages/semweb.html]] for details.
You can freely remove a graph by removing both files if the server is
not running. Similar, you can remove the journal to restore a graph to
its initial state after loading it from the source-data.

    $ httpd.log :
Keeps a log of HTTP interactions. Note that on heavily loaded servers
this can be a significant slow-down and the file can become huge.
Logging can be disabled either by not loading library(http/http_log) in
the startup script (see run.pl) or by clearing _|File in which to
log HTTP requests|_ in the settings-page.

On Unix systems, this file can be moved or removed at any time.  The
server will start a new log-file. On Windows this will give a sharing
violation.
