---+ Overview of ClioPatria

ClioPatria unifies the SWI-Prolog general Web support and Semantic Web
support, providing both a starting point for dedicated applications and
a platform for exchange of RDF-based data using a standardised language
and protocol.

`Out of the box', ClioPatria can be used to load and study RDF data. RDF
data can be studied using the interactive SPARQL interface, a graph
browser or the Prolog toplevel.

ClioPatria is first of all intended as a base-level infrastructure for
building RDF-based applications. This is achieved by loading additional
Prolog code that implements the required application logic on top of
the SWI-Prolog semweb package and optionally ClioPatria extensions
thereof.  Next, there are several options to make this application
logic available:

    * Define `APIs': HTTP handlers that emit JSON or XML that is
    handled by a presentation layer that resides either in the browser
    (using AJAX technology) or in another web-server.

    * Define HTTP handlers that emit HTML pages, possibly enriched
    with AJAX components.  This technique is used by the development
    tools that are part of ClioPatria.  More information on providing
    web-services from Prolog can be found on the SWI-Prolog
    [[HOWTO pages][http://www.swi-prolog.org/howto/http/]]

The choice between these two options depends on external requirements,
such as skills of the involved developers, integration with other
software and the amount of interaction. Serving HTML pages from Prolog
requires knowledge of HTML and CSS and the SWI-Prolog HTML-writer
library. It provides good modularity and reuse. Alternatively, the UI
can be programmed in e.g., flash or a generic JavaScript library such as
YUI. This approach makes the UI independent from the server, but
requires programming in two languages: Prolog to define the APIs and
flash/JavaScript/... to program the UI.
