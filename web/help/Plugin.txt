---+ The ClioPatria plugin architecture

ClioPatria plugins are Prolog source-files that can do two things:

  * Define hooks to alter the behavior of the existing application.
  Supported hooks are documented in hooks.pl.  An example is provided
  by examples/customise/EDM.pl.
  * Create an HTTP service.  Such services come in two types:
    * Services that produce HTML for human consumption
    * Services that produce XML or JSON for machines.

Plugins can be added to ClioPatria in   many different ways. To preserve
best modularity, we suggest to use config-enabled for loading plugins.
