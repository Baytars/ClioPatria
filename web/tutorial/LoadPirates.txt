---+ Load the Pirates data

We assume ClioPatria is still running and you are logged on, either as
=admin= or as a another user with at least _read_ and _write_ access.
The initial set of data is added to the _library_ as part of the
=pirates= packages and can be loaded using *|Repository/Load from
library|*.  Then select =|pirates -- Piracy data|= and click *load*.

---++ Explore the data

The main entry point for exploring the data is *|Places/graphs|*, which
lists the datasets loaded into ClioPatria.  Select the topmost graph,
which holds the piracy data.  The two most useful entry points are

  1. _predicates_, which lists all relations in the graph
  2. _classes_, which lists the types that are used in the graph

---++ The Web of Data

As you browse through the data, some links colored *red*. These are
resources that are not defined in the currently loaded dataset. Clicking
on such a link opens a page with information on where the resource is
used and the button *|Query the Linked Data cloud|*. Clicking this
button causes ClioPatria to retrieve the information from the resource
itself. In the ideal world, the resource (URI) points to an RDF document
that provides additional information about this resource.  Similar to
links in HTML documents, the target can be non-existent, might not be
a valid RDF document, etc.
