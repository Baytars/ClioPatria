---+ An Open Linked Piracy tutorial

This tutorial explains the basics of installing ClioPatria and applying
it to analyze RDF data and write a small web-service.

---++ Further reading

The pirates domain is a geospatial domain. To keep this tutorial simple
and considering the size of the dataset, we use naive Prolog
generate-and-test for answering queries. In realistic settings one needs
proper spatial indexing. This is implemented in the [[space
pachkage][http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/package/space.html]]

available. Willem Robert van Hage convinced me using this data.
