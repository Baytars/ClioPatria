---+ Query the pirate data with Prolog

ClioPatria is primarily a Prolog-based _|development platform|_. In this
lesson you learn to query the RDF data from the Prolog commandline. This
is a preparation for the next step, where you learn creating simple
Prolog programs.

Asking queries from the terminal is a practical step in contructing and
debugging more complex programs.
