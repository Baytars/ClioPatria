/** <module> ClioPatria skin

This page defines the overall layout of  ClioPatria pages. All pages are
returned using reply_html_page/3, using the   page class cliopatria(Id),
where Id is currently  always  =default=.   Pages  can  be  redefined by
providing a rule for user:body//2, where   the first argument must unify
with the page class.

The default skin provides the overall menu,   a  simple search form, the
content and the `server-address'. Because the   search-form uses the YUI
autocomplete widgets, the body must be of class =|yui-skin-sam|=.

The default skin provided by this can be overruled using two hooks:

	$ cliopatria:page_body//1 :
	Emit a page from the given content.  This hook can modify
	the overall page layout.
	$ cliopatria:server_address//0 :
	Write the address of the server.

This   library   also   provides   building     blocks,    notably   for
server_address//0:

	$ server_address//1 :
	Presents the version info and a link to a GIT module.
	$ current_page_doc_link//0 :
	Presents a link to the documentation of a page if the
	self-documentation facilities are loaded.  See run.pl.in.
